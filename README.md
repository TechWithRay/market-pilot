## AI-Powered Digital Marketing Tool

### Introduction
Navigating through marketing data can be overwhelming, often requiring extensive time and effort to find relevant information. This project aims to develop an AI-powered application to simplify these tasks, providing marketers with deeper insights. This allows them to concentrate on refining marketing strategies instead of getting bogged down by tedious and repetitive work.

### Roadmap
1. Integration of ChatGPT or other open-source LLMs
2. Incorporation of Google API for efficient search and information retrieval
3. Integration of the Whisper model
4. Collaboration features with Twilio, Slack, and Microsoft Office
5. Automation of calling, emailing, documentation, and follow-up tasks
6. Optional: Save information into a database
7. Development of a dashboard for data-driven marketing and visualization
8. Containerization and cloud deployment
